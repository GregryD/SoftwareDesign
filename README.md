# SoftwareDesign
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is requesting a web-based game to run on any operating system. The game is currently available as an android app and the name is “Draw It or Lost it”. The game will consist of 4 rounds lasting one minute each in which a picture is rendered slowly over a 30 second interval and teams guess what is being shown. If a team fails to guess the image the opposing teams get to answer for 15 seconds until time runs out.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  This document was constructed in order to decide the best operating platform, operating archetecture, storage management, memory management, security and network.  By analyzing the different options available to the Gaming Room the conclusions were developed on page 7, this is the most important part of this document. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Writing out each of the available option is very helpful to come to a conclusion of the best strategy to take.  The evaluation section was the most helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One area that I need improvement on is my comfortability with linux.  While this is a viable option for hosting my lack of confidence with it potentially made it not my first option. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Every project is different and many important parts need to be considered before it is decided which choices to make for each program.  Specifically the need to run on all platforms was very important in the decision making behind which platform to use.
